      "\n",
      "2. **Aging Population**: Japan has one of the highest life expectancies in the world, leading to a growing elderly population. The proportion of people aged 65 and older is increasing, which puts pressure on social welfare systems.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Economic Implications**: The shrinking workforce can lead to labor shortages, reduced economic growth, and increased pressure on social services and healthcare systems as the population ages.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Government Responses**: The Japanese government has tried various strategies to address the population decline, including financial incentives for families to have children, promoting gender equality in the workplace, and encouraging foreign immigration to fill job vacancies.\n",
      "\n",
